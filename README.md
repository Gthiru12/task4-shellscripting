# Shell Scripting Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice of **Linux Shell Scripting**.
The scripts are written using **Bash** and focus on automation and system tasks.

## Topics Covered

- Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)
- Variables and user input
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- System information scripts
- File and directory operations
- Log cleanup automation
- Backup scripts
- Output redirection
- Script permissions (`chmod +x`)
